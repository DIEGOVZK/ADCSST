# ADCSST

### üóíÔ∏è Description:
This project aims to develop a low-cost attitude determination module for the CubeSat developed by the super team project from OBSAT - MCTI. The attitude determination and control system (ADCS) is a subsystem of a CubeSat that is responsible for determining, maintaining and correcting the orientation and position of the satellite in orbit. The ADCS consists of sensors, actuators, and algorithms that work together to measure the attitude of the CubeSat and correct it when necessary.
